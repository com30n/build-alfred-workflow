# Build an Alfred workflow
Assemble the files within a source directory into an [Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) single package ready to be distributed.

The name of the output file is generated from the workflow name and version contained in the workflow's metadata.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

This action needs a file named `info.plist` with the metadata of your workflow in the root of your repo. This file is automatically generated for you when [exporting workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/sharing-workflows/) via the Alfred GUI.

### Inputs

* `workflow_dir`: Directory containing the sources of the workflow (defaults to `workflow`)
* `exclude_patterns`: List of excluded files/directories
* `template_files`: List of comma separated paths to files that would be used to template your `info.plist` file.
> #### Why it can be helpful?
> let's imagine that you have a `Script filter` where you wrote your python code,
> but you would like to develop the code using an IDE like pycharm, so using the option you can form your workflow from several files.
> 
> #### Usage:
>  To be able to add content of the files into you should put a template string into `info.plist` with the following structure:
   `TEMPLATE_THIS_[0-9]+`.  
   For example, if you want to put content of two files into `info.plist`, you should set 
   `template_files: "example1.py,example2.py"`, and put the template strings to the `info.plist` 
> ```xml
> ...
> <string>TEMPLATE_THIS_1
> </string>
> ...
> <string>TEMPLATE_THIS_2
> </string>
> ...
> ```
> each file will correspond to each template accordingly: `example1.py` will replace `TEMPLATE_THIS_1` and  `example2.py` will replace `TEMPLATE_THIS_2`  
> also you can put one file several times, just put the same template string to several places:
> ```xml
> ...
> <string>TEMPLATE_THIS_1
> </string>
> ...
> <string>TEMPLATE_THIS_2
> </string>
> ...
> <string>TEMPLATE_THIS_1
> </string>
> ...
> ```
> 

### Outputs

* `workflow_file`: The name of the created .alfredworkflow file

### Example workflow

On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gh-release) with the workflow file attached:
```yaml
name: Create Alfred Workflow

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build Alfred Workflow
        id: alfred_builder
        uses: com30n/build-alfred-workflow@v1
        with:
          workflow_dir: src
          exclude_patterns: '*.pyc *__pycache__/*'
          custom_version: ${{ github.ref_name }}
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: ${{ steps.builder.outputs.workflow_file }}
```

## Additional files

In addition to the files and folders contained in the `workflow_dir` some other files are also implicitily shipped within the target `workflow_file`. These files are searched for in the root directory and are silently ignored in case they don't exist:

* `info.plist` (*required*)
* `icon.png`
* `README`, `README.md`
* `LICENSE`
